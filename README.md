# OddlySatisfyingApp
 
## Purpose

This is a App-Project to explore how android apps can be made in Godot. The goal of this app is to relax its user by having a collection of different minigames that the user can enjoy and get the tingly feeling, like when watching videos of the oddlysatisfying subreddit.

## Use

If not opened in Godot, you can download the apk and install the app on your android phone. Be sure to turn on the "Apps from external sourcesÂ§ property. 

## Goal 

Sort the colored rectangles into the right order to achieve a nice color gradient
